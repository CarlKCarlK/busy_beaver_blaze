## Canonical Guide Moved

This file has moved. Please use the root-level `AGENTS.md` as the canonical AI development guide for Busy Beaver Blaze.

- Canonical: `AGENTS.md`
- Why: Some tools (Codex/Copilot Chat) only read root-level guides.

If you landed here from Copilot Chat or GitHub UI, open `AGENTS.md` at the repository root.
